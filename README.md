# connect
<ul>
<li>A wifi connection script using nmcli and dmenu
<li>For ease of use, type in "sudo ./connect.sh" because nmcli requires sudo privileges to function. 
<hr>
<li><b>Note:</b>
  <li>If you have spaces in your SSID, stop it, get some help (same with password).
  <li>Also, if you have no password, just press Enter.
  <li>This does not work in CLI, I will be releasing a CLI-only version soon.
</ul>
